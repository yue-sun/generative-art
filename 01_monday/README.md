## Day 1: Introduction and traditional methods

### Part 0: Introduction to generative art (Yue)
We will start with a brief overview of generative art with emphasis on nature, mathematics and physical systems. We will then go through the mini-course logistics and preview the topics to be covered. In addition, we will demonstrate the workflow of accessing course materials on the GitHub repo and running interactive Python notebooks on Google Colab.

### Part 1: Generative art with fractals (Jovana and Nina)
Known as “mathematical monsters” of the 17th century, fractals have since come to be appreciated as objects of complexity, beauty, and ubiquity in our daily lives, occurring in rugged mountainous landscapes, intricate vascular networks, and even our dinnertime broccoli. In these sessions, we will explore how to generate historically significant geometric and mathematical fractals, discuss their properties, and use them to create our first generative art.

### Part 2: Strange attractors (Nina)
An attractor is a state toward which a dynamical system evolves, such as a fixed point or a limit cycle. In this session, we will explore so-called “strange” attractors – complex orbits arising in chaotic systems whose trajectories can be quite... attractive!
