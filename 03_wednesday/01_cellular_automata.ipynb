        "The final application of cellular automata we'll consider here is diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA). This model dates back to 1981 in a [paper by Witten and Sander](https://ifisc.uib-csic.es/~tomas/MFCS/EdenDLA/PhysRevLett.47.1400.pdf), who proposed the model as a way to study dendritic structures of metal particles. In DLA, we imagine there are particles housed on a grid of cells. Each particle may be mobile or fixed, and each grid cell may be empty or occupied. When mobile particles come into contact with a fixed particle, they stick! We thus use three colors to refer to three different possible cell states: empty cell (0), cell with mobile particle (1), cell with fixed particle (2). DLA can be used to model processes like crystal growth through the diffusion of ions or molecules, or the condensation of water vapor to form snowflakes. The tree-like structures that develop in DLA systems also have fractal characteristics.\n",
