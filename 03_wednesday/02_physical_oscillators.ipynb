This is a system designed to model synchronization, such as of circadian systems of plants and animals. We will simulate three variations of the Kuramoto model:\n",

However, rather than assigning a binary state, $0$ or $1$, each oscillator carries a continuous state - _a phase_ - which varies from $0$ to $2\\pi$. These phases evolve continuously in time, governed by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) which prescribes their evolution based on nearest-neighbor interactions.\n",
